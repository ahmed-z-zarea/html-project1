<h2>How COVID-19 Spreads
</h2>
<p>

COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus.</br>
 These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth.</br>
 In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. </br>
 People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.

COVID-19 is spread in three main ways:
<ul>
<li>Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus.
</li>

<li>Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.
</li>
<li>Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.
</li>

</ul>
